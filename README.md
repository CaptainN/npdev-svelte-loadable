npdev:svetle-loadable
=====================

An easy way to split code at the component level dynamic imports for Meteor. This is a port from the original `svelte-loadable` project to Meteor, which adds SSR and hydration support, with a few other enhancements.

Documentation to come. Check out [this starter](https://github.com/CaptainN/meteor-svelte-starter) for example integration.
